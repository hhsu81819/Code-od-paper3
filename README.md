# Soil-moisture-regime-and-projection
-breakpoint.py

This generates the critical soil mositure values from given soil moisture and latent heat flux timeseries by different piecewise regressions.
The output is a netcdf file, here BP_SMxLE_CanESM5_1pctCO2_50 is an example.

-Postpro_regime.m

This reads the BP_SMxLE netcdf files and generates the fields for plotting for each models.

-Mode_Candidate.nc

This is the composite results from multiple climate models in this study. This is generated by mode of fields from BP_SMxLE files.
